                The global business scenario is no longer a matter of contending enterprises; rather it’s about competing supply chains. Today’s enterprise wants complete visibility into its end-to-end supply chain and seamless integration between internal systems and external parties. Even a minor disruption at any point can lead to the breakdown of the whole supply chain network. Obviously, that’s a difficult situation no enterprise wants to be in. Therefore, enterprises need to be able to predict and manage disruptions while effectively catering to significant customer demand. At the same time, they must cope with the ever-increasing pressure to lower cost and generate value for shareholders.
