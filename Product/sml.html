                A full suite of software developed by Stalwart Software (P) Ltd for designing Labels starting from Retail to Industrial purpose gives you the power to track and monitor your Inventory/Stores. Barcodes make doing business much more efficient for companies. Barcodes provide a method to track and store information about goods, from individual items to large stocks of thousands or even millions of items. They serve an important role and provide advantages compared with manually entering information.

               <strong>1. Error Prevention</strong> 
             </p></div>
            <div>
            <p>
                Errors in tracking make your inventory less accurate, which ultimately costs more money. Prior to barcodes, employees manually tracked individual items. Manual tracking leads to many human errors. Barcodes can track items with an error rate of about one error for every three million entries. At this rate, barcodes are nearly 10,000 times more accurate than manual entry.

                <strong> 2. Large Inventory Tracking</strong>
             </p></div>
            <div>
             <p>
                Without barcodes, companies that maintain inventories in the hundreds of thousands, or even millions, would have to scale back. They allow you to accurately track large stocks and also look up any single piece of merchandise in a matter of seconds.

               <strong> 3. Cost Savings </strong>   
             </p></div>
          <div>
             <p>
                Barcodes save lots of money. Prior to their advent, employees tracked merchandise. It costs more money to employ added workers, and more money and time are spent tracking large quantities of goods. Eliminating excess employees makes companies more efficient and increases the bottom line.       
             </p></div>
         <div>

            <strong>4.Speed</strong>       
           </p></div>
         <div>
           <p>
               The speed of a barcode tracking system is beneficial. For inventory purposes, the system's speed allows tracking to be done quickly. At checkout lines, barcodes can be scanned to immediately identify the cost of goods, so clerks don't have to type in prices. Customers don't have to wait longer when someone is purchasing several items. Every time a barcode is scanned, the item is immediately logged within the appropriate inventory.

              <strong>QR Codes - Enhancing the Efficiency of an Organization</strong>
           </p></div>  
           <div>
               <p>
                There are various advantages that you company will enjoy by using QR codes. They are able to significantly cut cost and boost productivity. Codes are generally printed on products which can be converted to an excellent opportunity to advertise the products and services of the company. Some companies create custom QR codes that set their codes apart from codes by other companies. This way, their customers will recognize their QR codes very easily. The QR codes are placed on the webpage and they can be captured or downloaded to a smartphone through the camera. After completing scanning process, the QR codes can be easily decoded by the customers so that they can know the details of your company’s plan or promotional scheme. Infact QR Codes can hold a lot of information about a product and even can be used as a label to describe a product, price and stock availability.
