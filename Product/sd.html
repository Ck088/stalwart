                 The sales team continuously monitors the changes taking place in the external environment regarding competitors, customers, government and other regulatory agencies, advances in technology, and industry trends. This provides the sales personnel with vital information regarding trends in organizational sales, product development, and budgets.

                By offering the management vital inputs pertaining to such information, the sales team helps the management to develop plans regarding sales, production, and design.

                The trends that have shaped the sales function include shorter product life cycles, longer and more complex sales cycles, reduced customer loyalty, intense competition among manufacturing firms, rising customer expectations, increasing buyer expertise, electronic revolution in communications, and the entry of women into the sales force.

                In addition to having a strong sales function, companies should also have efficient distribution channels to make the products available to the end consumer. Management of distribution channels involves efficient channel design, conflict management and implementation of sophisticated channel information systems which will enhance the process of making the products available to the end consumer in a timely manner.
